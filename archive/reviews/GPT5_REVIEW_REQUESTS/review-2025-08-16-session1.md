# GPT-5 Review Request - Session 1: Audit System & V1 Planning

## Summary of Changes
Established comprehensive audit and review system for V1 local-first architecture implementation. Created structured logging approach to maintain quality assurance during rapid development while leveraging GPT-5 expertise for technical validation.

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Audit Log Format**: Human-readable markdown in AUDIT.md for git-trackable change history
   - **Rationale**: Easy to review, version control friendly, accessible to team
   - **Alternative Considered**: JSON/structured format (rejected for complexity)
   - **Impact**: Enables continuous quality tracking and knowledge capture

2. **V1 Scope Lock**: Local-first development with focused feature set
   - **IN**: FastAPI+SSE, Redis+RQ, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, MinIO, Bedrock, RRF hybrid, citations
   - **OUT**: GraphQL, WebSockets, Neo4j, multi-node, managed services, SSO/RBAC
   - **Rationale**: Shortest path to valuable demo with "talk to codebases with receipts"
   - **Impact**: Clear deliverables and reduced complexity for Week 1 implementation

3. **Performance SLOs**: Concrete targets for demo credibility
   - **Search Latency**: p50 < 700ms, p95 < 1.2s (single-node OpenSearch)
   - **E2E Answer**: p95 < 2.0s including generation
   - **Golden Questions**: ≥8/10 Top-3 accuracy with citations
   - **Impact**: Clear success criteria and performance benchmarks

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
- **AUDIT.md**: Comprehensive change tracking with session-based entries
- **GPT5_REVIEW_REQUESTS/**: Directory structure for structured review requests
- **review-2025-08-16-session1.md**: This review request template

### Architecture Specifications Confirmed
- **RRF Parameters**: k=60, w_bm25=1.2, w_knn=1.0 (per GPT-5 guidance)
- **Citation System**: {path, start, end, commit, tool, model} mandatory for every result
- **Auto-Detection**: Dynamic embedding dimension from Bedrock Titan at startup
- **Container Resources**: 4-8GB RAM budget for full local stack

### Configuration Planning
- **OpenSearch**: Single-node with proper ulimits, -Xms2g -Xmx2g
- **Podman-Compose**: Full stack orchestration for local development
- **Bedrock Integration**: Titan embeddings + Claude generation with cost controls

## Performance Metrics
*Note: Infrastructure not yet implemented - metrics will be available from Session 2*

### Planned Measurements
- Container startup time and resource consumption
- OpenSearch index creation with auto-detection
- Search latency benchmarks against SLOs
- Bedrock token usage and cost tracking

## Questions for GPT-5

1. **Audit Process Validation**: Is this audit log structure sufficient for tracking quality during rapid V1 development? Any recommendations for improvement?

2. **V1 Scope Assessment**: Does the scope lock (IN/OUT decisions) represent the optimal balance for a compelling demo while maintaining development velocity?

3. **Performance SLO Realism**: Are the latency targets (p50 < 700ms, p95 < 1.2s) realistic for single-node OpenSearch with hybrid BM25+kNN search?

4. **Implementation Risk Assessment**: What are the highest-risk areas for the Week 1 delivery plan? Any critical issues to watch for?

5. **Architecture Validation**: Does the local-first approach with adapter pattern provide sufficient foundation for future cloud scaling?

## Next Steps Planned

### Day 1-2: Infrastructure Foundation
- Create podman-compose.yml with OpenSearch, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO
- Implement auto-detect embedding dimensions startup script
- Establish dynamic OpenSearch index mapping
- Basic health checks and service orchestration

### Day 3-4: Core Extractors & Search
- JSP EL/Label pairing extractor implementation
- Struts action→JSP tracer development
- RRF hybrid search with repo/commit filtering
- Performance validation against SLOs

### Day 5: Demo Integration
- Answer panel with citation display
- Golden questions integration and testing
- Prometheus metrics collection
- End-to-end demo scenario validation

## Request for GPT-5
Please review this audit and planning approach for quality, completeness, and strategic alignment. Identify any gaps or risks that should be addressed before beginning infrastructure implementation in Session 2.

Priority areas for feedback:
1. Audit system adequacy for quality assurance
2. V1 scope optimization for demo impact
3. Technical risk assessment and mitigation
4. Performance target validation
