# DocXP V1 Implementation Audit Log

## Overview
This audit log tracks all changes, decisions, and observations during the V1 local-first architecture implementation. Each session documents modifications, performance metrics, issues encountered, and lessons learned.

## [2025-08-16] Session 1: Audit System Setup & Planning

### Changes Made
- Created AUDIT.md audit log system for tracking implementation progress
- Established GPT-5 review process with structured feedback requests
- Updated project todos to reflect V1 scope lock and Week 1 deliverables
- Finalized V1 architecture: FastAPI+SSE, Redis+RQ, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, MinIO, Bedrock

### Decisions Made
- **Audit Strategy**: Human-readable markdown format for easy review and git tracking
- **GPT-5 Integration**: Daily review requests with structured summaries for quality assurance
- **V1 Scope Lock**: Local podman development, single-node OpenSearch, defer K8s/GraphQL/Neo4j
- **Performance SLOs**: p50 < 700ms, p95 < 1.2s for search; p95 < 2.0s for E2E answers

### Architecture Specifications Confirmed
- **RRF Hybrid Search**: k=60, w_bm25=1.2, w_knn=1.0 for optimal precision
- **Citation Requirements**: {path, start, end, commit, tool, model} on every result
- **Auto-Detection**: Dynamic embedding dimension detection from Bedrock Titan at startup
- **Golden Questions**: Nightly regression testing with ≥8/10 Top-3 accuracy requirement

### Performance Targets
- **Search Latency**: p50 < 700ms, p95 < 1.2s (single-node OpenSearch)
- **E2E Answer Time**: p95 < 2.0s including generation
- **Golden Questions**: ≥8/10 correct snippet in Top-3 with citations, >85% answerable
- **Resource Budget**: 4-8GB RAM total for full stack

### Issues Identified
- **Current State**: Dual SQLite bottleneck (app + ChromaDB) limiting scalability
- **Migration Complexity**: Need careful data migration from ChromaDB to OpenSearch
- **Performance Risk**: Single-node OpenSearch may become bottleneck at scale

### Next Session Focus
- Create podman-compose.yml with full stack (OpenSearch, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
- Implement auto-detect embedding dimensions startup script
- Establish OpenSearch index with dynamic mapping
- Set up basic health checks and container orchestration

### Questions for GPT-5 Review
1. **Audit Process**: Is the audit log structure sufficient for tracking V1 implementation?
2. **Architecture Validation**: Confirm V1 scope lock decisions are sound for demo goals
3. **Performance SLOs**: Are the latency targets realistic for single-node OpenSearch?
4. **Implementation Priority**: Validate Week 1 day-by-day delivery plan
