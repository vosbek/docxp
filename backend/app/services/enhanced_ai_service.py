You are a senior business analyst with deep understanding of software architecture. You're analyzing code within a comprehensive system context to extract business rules that drive real business value.

## üó∫Ô∏è HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT

**Entity Being Analyzed**: {entity.type.title()} "{entity.name}"
**System Location**: {hierarchy_context}
**Module**: {module_context}
**Class Context**: {class_context or 'N/A'}
**File**: {entity.file_path}
**Line**: {entity.line_number or 'N/A'}

## üîó RELATED SYSTEM COMPONENTS

{related_context}

## üíª COMPLETE CODE ANALYSIS

### Primary Code (Full Context)
```{Path(entity.file_path).suffix}
{full_code}
```

{cross_file_context}

{keywords_context}

## üéØ ENHANCED EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Understand Business Context
Before analyzing code, understand:
- What business domain does this {entity.type} serve?
- How does it fit in the overall system workflow?
- What business capabilities does it enable or constrain?
- Who are the stakeholders affected by this code?

### Step 2: Identify Business Logic Patterns
Look for these enhanced indicators:
- **Business Process Logic**: Workflow steps, state transitions, approval chains
- **Business Calculations**: Pricing, scoring, financial formulas, metrics
- **Business Validations**: Data quality rules, business constraints, compliance checks
- **Business Decisions**: Conditional logic based on business criteria
- **Business Integrations**: External system rules, data transformation rules
- **Business Security**: Role-based access, permission logic, audit requirements
- **Business Configuration**: Configurable business rules, feature flags, business parameters

### Step 3: Enhanced Categorization System
**üìä Data Validation & Quality**: Input validation, data integrity, format checking, business data quality rules
**üßÆ Business Calculations**: Financial formulas, pricing logic, scoring algorithms, business metrics calculation
**‚ö° Workflow & Process**: Business process steps, state machines, approval workflows, business sequence logic
**üîê Authorization & Security**: Business access control, role-based permissions, compliance requirements
**‚öñÔ∏è Business Constraints**: Business limits, thresholds, quotas, policy enforcement, SLA requirements
**üîÑ Integration & Transformation**: External system business rules, data mapping rules, API business logic
**üéõÔ∏è Configuration & Features**: Business rule configuration, feature toggles, business parameter management
**üìã Compliance & Audit**: Regulatory requirements, audit trails, business reporting rules

### Step 4: Business Impact Assessment
For each rule, consider:
- What happens to the business if this rule fails?
- Who in the business organization depends on this rule?
- What business processes would be disrupted?
- What compliance or regulatory requirements does it support?

### Step 5: Cross-Reference Analysis
Use the related components to understand:
- How this rule interacts with other business rules
- What upstream/downstream business impacts exist
- Whether this rule is part of a larger business workflow

  }}
]
```

## ‚ö° ENHANCED QUALITY STANDARDS

### Business Language + Code Traceability Requirements
- Write descriptions that business stakeholders understand AND architects can trace to code
- Always include specific method names, class names, and file locations
- Show complete method call chains when rules span multiple components
- Indicate architectural boundary crossings (presentation‚Üíbusiness‚Üídata)
- Use arrow notation (‚Üí) to show execution flow and method calls
- Reference specific line numbers when available from the code context

### Context Awareness + Implementation Mapping
- Reference the hierarchical location and related components WITH file paths
- Map business workflow steps to actual method call sequences
- Show how business rules connect across class and module boundaries
- Include integration points with external systems and their implementing classes
- Note cross-cutting concerns and their implementation patterns

### Architect-Focused Actionability
- Each rule must be traceable to specific code locations for impact analysis
- Include method call chains for understanding system behavior during changes
- Provide file paths and class references for immediate code navigation
- Show boundary spans for understanding architectural implications
- Support migration planning with precise technical implementation details

## üîç ADVANCED ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS

### Pattern Recognition
- Look for business rule families that work together
- Identify business invariants that must be maintained
- Spot business configuration patterns vs. hard-coded rules
- Recognize business exception handling patterns

### Evolution Indicators
- Note business rules that might need to change frequently
- Identify rules that might be candidates for externalization
- Spot rules that indicate technical debt or business process issues
- Flag rules that might impact scalability or performance

### Migration Insights
- Identify rules that would be difficult to migrate
- Note rules that might need business stakeholder review during migration
- Flag rules that might indicate integration complexity
- Identify rules that could benefit from modernization

## üéØ EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT

### Excellent Architect-Focused Business Rule

You are a senior software architect who translates technical business rules into clear explanations that maintain precise code traceability. Your goal is to help architects understand BOTH the business purpose AND exactly where to find the implementation.

## üéØ RULE TO TRANSLATE

**Rule ID**: {rule.rule_id}
**Technical Description**: {rule.description}
**Business Category**: {rule.category}
**Implementation Context**: {entity.type} "{entity.name}" in {rule.module_path}
**File Location**: {entity.file_path}:{entity.line_number or 'N/A'}

## üîó RELATED SYSTEM COMPONENTS
{related_context}

## üíª COMPLETE CODE CONTEXT
```{Path(entity.file_path).suffix}
{code_context[:2000]}
```

## üìã ARCHITECT-FOCUSED TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS

Create an explanation that serves architects by providing:

1. **Business Purpose in Plain English** - What business rule does this enforce?
2. **Precise Code Implementation** - Which methods, classes, and files implement this?
3. **Cross-Boundary Traceability** - How does this rule span across classes/modules?
4. **Integration Points** - Where does this rule connect to other system components?

## ‚úÖ EXAMPLES OF ARCHITECT-FOCUSED TRANSLATIONS

**Poor Example** (Too vague):
"Customers cannot make payments for negative amounts or exceed their credit limit"

**Excellent Example** (Code traceable):
"Customers cannot make payments for negative amounts or exceed their approved credit limit ‚Üí implemented in PaymentValidator.validateAmount() called from PaymentService.processPayment(), with credit limit validation in CreditChecker.verifyLimit() (spanning validation‚Üíbusiness‚Üíexternal services)"

**Poor Example**:
"Only authorized employees can view confidential documents"

**Excellent Example**:
"Only authorized employees can view confidential documents based on their job role ‚Üí enforced in DocumentSecurityService.checkAccess() which calls UserRoleService.hasPermission() and integrates with AuthorizationManager.validateDocumentAccess() (spanning security‚Üíuser-management‚Üídocument-access boundaries)"

## üìù ENHANCED OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide a two-part explanation:

**Business Rule**: [Plain English business explanation]
**Implementation**: [Precise code location and method chain with boundary indicators]

Format: "Business Rule ‚Üí Implementation details (boundary spans)"

## üéØ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Always include specific method names** when identifiable from code
2. **Reference class names and file locations** for traceability  
3. **Indicate boundary crossings** (e.g., validation‚Üíbusiness‚Üídata layers)
4. **Show method call chains** when the rule spans multiple components
5. **Use arrow notation (‚Üí)** to separate business explanation from implementation
6. **Include file/class context** in parentheses for quick code navigation

Generate an architect-focused explanation that enables immediate code navigation and system understanding.
